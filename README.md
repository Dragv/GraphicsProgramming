# Graphics Programming

## Overview

I keep wanting to do a more professional set of instructional projects on Graphics programming. And I've been asked to do some guest lectures, so I thought this would
be a great opportunity to put my thoughts into something more concrete.

I hope to be adding to this over time - this is not intended to be a one-off. I have multiple disjoint projects and codebases that I would like to solidify into one repository.
